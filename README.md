## Installation
Clone this repo and copy custom_components/OctopusAgile to <homeassistant config>/custom_components/OctopusAgile
  
Alternatively, install via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)

## Configuration
NOTE: the GUI configuration flow is currently not implemented.

See the example configuration.yaml config below

### region_code
This should match the [DNO region code](https://www.energy-stats.uk/dno-region-codes-explained/) as per the Octopus Agile API - look for "E-1R-AGILE-18-02-21-" on your [API dashboard](https://octopus.energy/dashboard/developer/) and the next letter is your region code.

### mpan, serial, and auth
Your MPAN and serial number are listed on your [API dashboard page](https://octopus.energy/dashboard/developer/). "*auth*" is your API key from the same page.

### moneymakers
The concept of moneymakers is devices that should always turn on if the price drops to 0 or below. 
This can either be a switch or climate device. Note that I have only tested this with my tado thermostat. 
Populate params as per the example for climate.

Moneymakers are added to the octopusagile.timers entity which is then checked at the beginning of each half hour to decide if the device should be on or off.

### timers
Timers are used to turn devices on for a set number of hours each day.
I have been using this to turn my immersion heater on for 5 hours a day at the cheapest half hour periods.
day_from/day_to can be either "today" or "tomorrow", this is in reference to when the timers are updated (currently hardcoded to 1900Z each day)

Moneymakers are added to the octopusagile.timers entity which is then checked at the beginning of each half hour to decide if the device should be on or off.

The concept of requirements is best explained with an example. My water heater should turn on for 5 hours each day, 
however it should run for at least and hour between 1900 and 0600 and at least an hour between 1000 and 1600 to ensure that we always have hot water.

Hopefully the other options are self explanatory. 

### run_devices
This creates a entity detailing the best time period to run a device that needs x number of hours to run.
Taking the dishwasher as an example, it runs for 3.5 hours but most energy is used in the first 2.5 so base the run time on 2.5 hours. I want to run the dishwasher before 0800 each night.
An entity named octopusagile.dishwasher is created in Home assistant.

### sensor
Create a sensor for each of: current rate, previous rate and next rate

### octopusagile.avg_rate_inc_peak
The average rate from the day update_timers runs at 23:00 to 22:30 the next day, including the peak.

### octopusagile.timers
All timers as created by the timer configuration listed in entity attribute

### octopusagile.region_code
Region code as set in configuration

### octopusagile.half_hour_timer_nextupdate

### octopusagile.<run_device_name>
A seperate entity for each configured run_device with the time stored in state and start time, start in, end in and average rate stored in the attributes

## Example usage
### Dashboard
Note that i am using an owl energy monitor for the energy usage stats. I will look at pulling these stats direct from octopus once my agile account is setup
